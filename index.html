                In 1914, the Southern Nigeria Protectorate was combined with the Northern Nigerian Protectorate to create the Colony and 
                Protectorate of Nigeria, which has the borders of modern-day Nigeria. By the late 1950s, the call for independence of 
                territories in Africa and the decline of the British Empire led to the country being granted independence on 1 october 1960 as 
                the Federation of Nigeria. Three years later, the constitution was amended and the country was declared the Federal Republic of 
                Nigeria with Nnamdi Azikiwe, previously Governor General, as the first president.
